# tic_tac_toe
it's a tic-tac-toe game made with pygame

To make this work you are going to need the python version 3.7.9 with pygame 2.0.1.
I have also added a requirements.txt file, so you can just download everything with 
	pip install -r requirements.txt
or
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
.
In the command line it also tells you if it's a draw or not and if it isn't, it tells you who won.
ou can just place a cross/circle by just clicking on the square you want to place it in.
It just starts out with the cross and then just switches between the two as you go.
The code is all nicely commented so you should be able to understand what everything does.
I really hope that some beginners can use this to learn something new :)
